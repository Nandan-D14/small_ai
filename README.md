# My AI Model ðŸš€

This repository implements a small AI model using **Supervised Learning**.

## Steps to Run the program
  1.  Make a clean tree structure of your files.
  2.  Collect a good text based dataset.
         > 10MB-20MB data gives average output.
         > 50MB-100MB+ data gives more and more better output.
  3.  After collecting a dataset once make sure in in tokenizer.py train.py and main.py assigned correct path of data file.
  4.  Then run this file one by one :
               tokenizer.py -> train.py ->  main.py
  5.  During traing it will take lot of time ( larger dataset it will take more time )
  6.  Once training completed check how much loss you get if loss is more your model is not perform good
      to reduce the loss train with good data and increase the epoch number in train.py.
  7.  Finally run main.py and give input and check the output if output is not good your model is not train well
